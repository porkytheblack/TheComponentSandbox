# The Component Sandbox 🚀🚀
- Trying to build a React Component, and don't have the time to setup a new react app, or refactor your code in order to include it in your current project?

## Included packages
- Tailwindcss
- React Router
- Redux
- Typescript
- ant desing
- material ui
- ant design icons
- material ui icons
- Styled Components
- Chart.js

### All you have to do is:
1. `git clone https://github.com/porkytheblack/TheComponentSandbox` 
2. `cd TheCodeSandbox`
3. `git checkout with-backend`
4. `git pull`
5. `cd TheComponentSandbox/sandbox`
6. `yarn`
7. `yarn start`
8. `cd ../sandbox-backend`
9. `yarn`
10. `yarn start`

- then get started adding your new component to the component folder
- add a route to your new component in the Router
- modify the routes.ts file to include a link to the new component 
- start working on the component and view it on your browser

## The backend
If you clone the with-backend branch you get additional features, that allow you to:
1. Edit you code directly from your browser
2. View All your code in the browser
3. No need to manually add routes to the react app

**Note** You have to checkout to the with backend repo for it to work

### Happy deving😁

**Ohh, and before I forget, Ignore the antd warnings, it is an open issue and far from a fix, so everything will still work OK, if you want you can ignore the warnings on webpack**
